I've created `REPO_MAP.md` at the repository root. The document includes:

1. **Project overview** - Tech stack and brief description
2. **Directory structure** - Tree view with purposes
3. **Entry points** - Where the app starts
4. **Component architecture** - Hierarchy and responsibilities with line numbers
5. **State management** - How data flows through the app
6. **Styling overview** - Theme, colors, and CSS patterns
7. **NPM scripts** - Available commands
8. **Key patterns** - React conventions used
9. **Quick reference table** - What file to modify for different changes

The document is concise at ~120 lines and provides an AI agent with everything needed to understand and work on this codebase.
